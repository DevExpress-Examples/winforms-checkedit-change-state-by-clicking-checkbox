# How to force the CheckEdit to change its state only when clicked in the glyph


<p>By default, the CheckEdit changes the check state when being clicked anywhere within its bounds. However, sometimes it is necessary that the CheckBox changes the check state only if a click was made exactly in the glyph area. To achieve this, you need to handle the MouseDown event. Within the MouseDown event handler, you can manually check whether a user clicks on a glyph rectangle and allow or suppress subsequent processing.</p>
